        <h3>Learning Blockchain: How It Works and Everything in Between.</h3>
            <p class="flex-card-content-text">
                The past decade has opened us to several revolutionary technologies. However, none of them has 
                been as underused and underappreciated as blockchain. Traditionally known for cryptocurrencies, 
                blockchain has provided us with a fast, secure, ubiquitous, transparent, and reliable platform for 
                verifying transactions and recording confidential information.

                The 2020 US Presidential Election is still underway. It’s been over three days and there is still no verdict. 
                While it’s an unprecedented situation, with over 100 million mail-in ballots to be counted, we should’ve gone 
                digital long ago.
