            <p>
                At Blockbrainers we contribute to Blockchain projects. We develop Decentralized Applications
                and already have contributed to many DEFI (Decentralized Finance) projects and built DAOs (Decentralized Anonymous Organization).
                We either develop entire projects or integrate external teams to help them to change the world.
